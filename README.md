## Diffusion-Models
Diffusion Models are a class of generative models that have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to generate high-quality data, particularly in the field of image synthesis. These models work by simulating the process of diffusion, where data is gradually transformed from a simple distribution (like Gaussian noise) to a complex distribution that resembles the target data.
